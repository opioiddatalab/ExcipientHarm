**Background**<br>
Clinical consequences of injecting solid pharmaceutical excipients (talc, starch) include serious vascular and pulmonary damage. Yet other harms have not been systematically cataloged.<br>

**Objectives**<br>
Conduct a systematic review of excipient harms from controlled substances, without regard to specific outcomes.<br>

**Methods**<br>
[1 Design] We conducted a comprehensive literature search in December 2019 across four bibliographic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Sociological Abstracts. Search terms were developed that focused on three elements: brand & generic drugs in four classes (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, stimulants and opioids), inactive ingredients, and injection.
<br>[2 Search] Drug names identified by established product class in FDALabel v2.4 (market years: 1926-2019); UNII extracted from 2177 DailyMed SPL. Canonical list of historical and global brand & generic names from claims, PDMP data, ATC codes & Wikipedia was curated.
<br>[3 Outcome] Any physiological harm from solid oral and transdermal stimulants, opioids, benzodiazepines, barbiturates administered by injection
<br>[4 Analysis] VigiGrade; bias assessment; UMC causality<br>
<br>
**Results**<br>
After duplicates were removed, we identified 9,460 references that were prioritized for manual review using machine learning. In total, we manually screened 4,329 studies, of which 237 were categorized as relevant based on title and abstract and moved forward to full-text review. Of those, 101 papers (publication years 1966-2019, two peaks: 1980, late 2010s), mostly case reports, were extracted in duplicate & adjudicated. Harms to lungs, heart, eyes, skin were commonly reported. Birefringent particles (talc, starch, silicates) in histology were identified for decades, with most definitively stated harms from excipients being occlusion & thrombosis. An alternative etiology, related to Nicolau's Syndrome, has emerged more recently, focusing on immune complement cascade.<br>
<br>
**Conclusions**<br>
Identifying specific excipient harms could inform pharmaceutical design to mitigate them. Harm reduction strategies for avoiding the most dangerous excipients could be further developed.
